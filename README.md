Mhm yes coding and stuff

Hey, so I actually have no idea why you are here. But while I have you attention, here's a little bit about myself:

One of my favorite quotes is, "Jack of all trades, master of none. But oftentimes better than a master of one"

You'll notice that I spend a little bit of time on a lot of projects. When I get around to it, I usually circle back and finish up past ones, but for the most part I like to keep my options very wide. Everything from Arduino to full stack web development, I'm completely down to try it. The only way to guarantee you'll never succeed is to never attempt to begin with. In the process, we may learn something along the way.
