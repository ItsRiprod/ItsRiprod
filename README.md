Hi, I'm Riprod. I like to take long walks on the beach and enjoy the sun. Now that I know you're not just a filthy casual, I can get into an explanation. I'm still in college but my desire to excel hasn't even begun to die down. I enjoy anything I can get my hands on regarding code. Below, I have a few of my projects laid out, and I hope you have the chance to look through a couple of them. Though I may not be a professional, I enjoy the process and maybe we'll finish a project.

You'll notice that I spend a lot of time on a lot of projects. When I get around to it, I usually circle back and finish up past ones, but for the most part, I like to keep as many options available to me as possible. I'm completely down to try everything from Arduino to full-stack web development. The only way to guarantee you'll never succeed is to never attempt in the first place. In the process, we may learn something along the way.

One of my favorite quotes: 
> "Jack of all trades, master of none. But oftentimes better than a master of one"
