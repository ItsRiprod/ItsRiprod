Hi, I'm Riprod. I like to take long walks on the beach and enjoy the sun. Now that I know you're not just a filthy casual, I can get into an explanation. I'm still in college but my desire to excel hasn't even begun to die down. I enjoy anything I can get my hands on regarding code. Below, I have laid out a few of my projects, and I hope you can look through a couple of them. Though I may not be a professional, I enjoy the process and maybe we'll finish a project.

You'll notice that I spend a lot of time on projects. When I get around to it, I usually circle back and finish up past ones, but for the most part, I like to keep as many options available to me as possible. I'm completely down to try everything from Arduino to full-stack web development. The only way to guarantee you'll never succeed is to never attempt in the first place. In the process, we may learn something along the way.
